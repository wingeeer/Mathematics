Course content:

"A brief overview of classical ciphers. Algorithms for primality testing. Basic algorithms for computation of discrete logarithms in cyclic groups. Index-calculus algorithms for computation of discrete logarithms in finite fields. Elliptic curves over finite fields. Algorithms for factorization of integers. Lattices and the LLL algorithm. Diffie-Hellman, public-key encryption (ElGamal, RSA, lattice-based), digital signatures (RSA, Schnorr)."


Here are selected weekly assignments from the course showing some reasoning about number theory, discrete logarithms, the RSA encryption and some block ciphers, proficiency in LaTeX and some coding in MATLAB (ov4 and ov5).

You will also find a summary of the course that I wrote as preparation for the exam (coursesummary.pdf).
