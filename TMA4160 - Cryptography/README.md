Course content:

"A brief overview of classical ciphers. Algorithms for primality testing. Basic algorithms for computation of discrete logarithms in cyclic groups. Index-calculus algorithms for computation of discrete logarithms in finite fields. Elliptic curves over finite fields. Algorithms for factorization of integers. Lattices and the LLL algorithm. Diffie-Hellman, public-key encryption (ElGamal, RSA, lattice-based), digital signatures (RSA, Schnorr)."


Here are selected exercises from the course showing some reasoning and some coding in MATLAB.

You will also find a summary of the course that I wrote.
