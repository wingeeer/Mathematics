A final project I wrote about the Banach-Tarski paradox which famously states that there exists a (finite) decomposition of the solid ball in Euclidean 3-space such that the parts can be put together to make two identical copies of the original ball. This was to complete the course MA3001 "Mathematical Seminar for Master Degree Students" which covers a topic selected by the students attending the given year. The subject for the course this year (2013) was "The foundations of mathematics".
